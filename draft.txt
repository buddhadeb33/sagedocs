1. Implementation Steps
Step 1: Questions Bank Module
Design the Database:

Use Amazon DynamoDB to store questions with attributes:
QuestionID (Primary Key)
Domain (e.g., Finance, Healthcare)
TechStack (e.g., Python, Java)
Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
Tags (e.g., Algorithm, Design)
Client (e.g., ClientA, ClientB)
Question Tagging Service:

Create a Lambda function to tag and categorize questions based on input metadata (domain, tech stack, etc.).
Use API Gateway to expose this service for admins to add questions.
Batch Uploads:

Use an S3 bucket to upload question files (CSV/JSON).
Trigger a Lambda function upon file upload to batch process and add questions to DynamoDB.
Step 2: Interview Engine Module
Question Filtering:

Create a Lambda function to query DynamoDB based on filters like:
Domain, TechStack, Difficulty, Client requirements.
Return a dynamic set of questions to the frontend.
Concurrent Interviews:

Use Amazon SQS to queue interview sessions.
Assign interview panels dynamically by reading from SQS.
Response Tracking:

Store candidate responses in DynamoDB with attributes:
CandidateID (Partition Key)
SessionID (Sort Key)
QuestionID, Answer, Timestamp
Step 3: Score Calculation Module
AI/ML Scoring:

Train a model using Amazon SageMaker to analyze text answers:
Use NLP techniques (e.g., BERT, GPT-based embeddings) for pattern matching.
Deploy the trained model as a SageMaker Endpoint.
Create a Lambda function to call the SageMaker Endpoint and retrieve scores.
Traditional Scoring:

Implement weight-based scoring:
Assign weights to tech stacks or domains during the question creation.
Use a Lambda function to calculate weighted scores.
Manual SME Review Option:

Provide a UI for SMEs to review and override scores via a Cognito-secured frontend.
Step 4: Reporting and Analytics
Repeated Question Analysis:

Use Amazon Athena to query DynamoDB or S3 logs for insights.
Identify frequently used or underutilized questions.
Dynamic Reports:

Use Amazon QuickSight to generate visual reports:
Usage patterns.
Candidate performance.
2. Deployment Steps
Step 1: Infrastructure Setup
Networking:

Use Amazon VPC to host the backend components securely.
Set up subnets for public (API Gateway, S3) and private (DynamoDB, Lambda, SageMaker) resources.
Storage:

Create an S3 bucket for:
Uploading question files.
Storing candidate response logs for analytics.
Databases:

Set up DynamoDB for:
Questions bank.
Candidate responses.
Step 2: Deploy Serverless Backend
API Gateway:

Deploy REST endpoints for:
Adding questions.
Filtering questions.
Submitting responses.
Lambda Functions:

Deploy functions for:
Processing and tagging questions.
Filtering questions for interviews.
Scoring answers via SageMaker Endpoint.
SageMaker Models:

Train an NLP model using historical data.
Deploy the model with auto-scaling endpoints.
Step Functions:

Create a state machine to orchestrate tasks:
Question selection → Candidate response storage → Scoring.
Step 3: Frontend Deployment
Frontend Hosting:

Deploy static files (HTML, CSS, JS) to an S3 bucket.
Enable CloudFront for CDN delivery (optional).
Authentication:

Integrate Amazon Cognito for user authentication.
Define roles for Admin, Hiring Manager, and Candidate.
Step 4: CI/CD Pipeline
Code Repository:

Store code in AWS CodeCommit or GitHub.
Build and Deploy:

Use AWS CodePipeline for:
Automatically building the Lambda functions.
Deploying updates to S3, API Gateway, and SageMaker.
Testing:

Use AWS CodeBuild for automated testing:
API integration tests.
Lambda unit tests.
Step 5: Monitoring and Optimization
Logging:

Enable CloudWatch Logs for all Lambda functions.
Use X-Ray for debugging API requests.
Cost Monitoring:

Set up AWS Budgets to track costs.
Use Trusted Advisor to optimize resource usage.
